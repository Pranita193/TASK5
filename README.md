The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied. This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e value of the common field will be the same. 
A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, along with matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.
RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join. It is very similar to LEFT JOIN for the rows for which there is no matching row on the left side, the result-set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN. 
FULL JOIN creates the result-set by combining results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The result-set will contain all the rows from both tables. For the rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.
